# API Docs Open API standard


As i stated in *README.md* api docs already generate in each server running based on open api standard and generate with swagger (both of them).
i attach generated .yml file based from swagger itself

## Auth Service
if docker-compose running already running, api-docs swagger in this url :
`localhost:9000/api-docs`

detail docs generated in :
`auth-service-api-docs.yml`
## Fetch Service
if docker-compose running already running, api-docs swagger in this url :
`localhost:9001/api-docs/index.html`

detail docs generated in :
`fetch-service-api-docs.yml`


## Notes
detailed docs (`fetch-service-api-docs.yml`) and (`auth-service-api-docs.yml`) can import for [swagger-online-editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
